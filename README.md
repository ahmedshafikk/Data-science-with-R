# üìä Data Science Project

Welcome to my Data Science project! This project focuses on data preprocessing, machine learning, and clustering techniques to analyze and model healthcare data. üè•

## Project Overview
This project covers a wide range of data science techniques and libraries to analyze healthcare data. It is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Medical Center Analysis
In this part, we explore medical center data, perform data preprocessing, and build machine learning models for predicting patient no-shows.

### Part 2: Clustering Health Data
In the second part, we delve into clustering techniques to group health-related data for better insights.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary R packages mentioned in the code, including `rpart`, `rpart.plot`, `caret`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`, `keras`, `e1071`, `pROC`, and others.

2. Make sure you have the dataset ready in the specified directory (`medicalcentre.csv` for Part 1 and `framingham.csv` for Part 2).

3. Run the R code sections provided in the project to perform data preprocessing, build machine learning models, and visualize the results.
